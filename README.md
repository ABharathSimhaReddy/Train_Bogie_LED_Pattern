# Train_Bogie_LED_Pattern
A dynamic Train Bogie LED Pattern system that simulates train movement using sequential LED transitions. LEDs turn ON and OFF in smooth left-to-right and right-to-left motion, creating realistic entry and exit effects. Ideal for embedded projects using PIC microcontrollers.
